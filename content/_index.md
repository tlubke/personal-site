Hi,

Welcome to my personal site! This is a static site built with hugo, with a modified version of the x-min theme. I built it as a place to share my personal projects and showcase my music.

I've got some recordings and viewable scores on the music page. And the posts page goes into detail on some of my projects and other things I've worked on.

You can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/tlubke/personal-site).
