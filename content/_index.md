Hi,

Welcome to my personal site! It's pretty new at the moment so things will be changing quickly, and this probably won't stay for long. This is a static site built with hugo, with a modified version of the x-min theme (It has LaTeX support!). I built it as a place to share my personal projects and showcase my music.

The music page will be a little empty until I translate my composition portfolio over. And I'm still deciding how I want people to be able to listen to music from this site. In the meantime, the bandcamp link in the footer has a few of my recordings, and I'll try to post some of my scores on there if I can.

Please let me know if anything looks funny on whatever device you are using.

## Upcoming Performances

### UI Symphony Orchestra
- 2/26
- 3/25
- 4/29
- 5/4 + 5/6

### Chamber
- TBD [Beethoven Piano Trio Op. 1 No. 1 in Eb]

Look, I can post equations!

`$${
\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{2}}}} = ???
}$$`
