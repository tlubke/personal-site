Tyler Lubke was born, raised, and currently resides in Iowa.

Originally from the driftless region (Ope! That's way up there by Minnesota if ya didn't know), he now makes his home in Iowa City as a programmer, musician, and hobbyist of too many things.

At the moment, Tyler studies Double Bass and Computer Science at the University of Iowa. He plays and writes folk, contemporary-classical, and experimental-electronic music, and in addition, programs unique instruments to help perform and write in that last category.
