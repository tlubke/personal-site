Tyler Lubke was born, raised, and currently resides in Iowa.

Hailing from the driftless region, he now makes his home in Iowa City as an instrumentalist, composer, programmer, and a hobbyist of too many things for his own good.

At the moment, Tyler studies Double Bass and Computer Science at the University of Iowa, and particularly enjoys finding ways to combine his interests in music, visual arts, and programming.
