Last semester I decided to kill two birds in one stone by learning LaTeX through setting my calculus workshops. I figured, since this site has LaTeX support, a good way of testing it, and showing off the feature would be to post my workshops.

Right away I found out that I couldn't just copy and paste the scripts, because this site *only* supports equations, however inside of `\text{}`, equations still work, so I knew I could write some code to process all of my workshops into something readable in this markdown format.

# Workshop-1

`$${
\text{xxx \(x + y = z\)}
}$$`
