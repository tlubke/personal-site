I started this version of my website on Christmas day, 2019. 

After the domain of my personal site expired, I didn't feel the need to renew it. My first from-scratch-totally-manual-raw-HTML static-site, much like that unnecessarily string of words, was messy. I didn't know enough at the time to be able to implement my design ideas, so the website was left unchanged for about a year. It sat and collected dust in my github personal site repo in that time.

After gaining more experience, I rebuilt my website with angular, only to find github doesn't support NodeJS on personal pages, so I decided to go back to static.

I actually originally tried to use Jekyll, as it was the most popular option, but there were some issues installing on my 2011 Macbook. Hugo was my second option, but after working with it, I think it's the better one.

Build times are incredibly fast (handy since I'm on an older machine), theme's provide an easy starting point, and the documentation is fairly good once you get going. I had to look at the source code of a few sites before I really got the hang of it though (I'm no expert by any means).

I expect there to many iterations of this website, but here's what it looks like at the time right before I deploy it for the first time.
