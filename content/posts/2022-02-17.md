It's been about a year and a half since I've made a change to this website. I'm not sure how much traffic it gets or who takes the time to read these posts. But I like to post a little update any time I make changes to the site. 

This one was fairly small, it involves a simple change from hugo templating to raw HTML/Javascript. As you may have noticed, there is a date displayed in the header of the home page. Previously I was using hugo's `now` variable to format that date, which displays correctly when the site server is running locally in my laptop. However, when deployed on netlify, `now` stays frozen at the time it was built. So, a simple fix is to use the `Date` class built into most modern browsers.

The hugo code
```
{{ now.Format "January 01, 2006" }}
```
can simply be replaced with this one-liner to get the date and time straight from the browser.
```
<script>document.write(new Date().toLocaleDateString("en-US", { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' }))</script>
```

The only other changes to the site in this update were to the homepage and the now-called "posts" page. The homepage is now more succinct and up-to-date, and the "projects" page was renamed to "posts" because it functions more as a blog than a complete overview of my personal projects.
