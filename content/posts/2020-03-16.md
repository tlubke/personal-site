Being stuck inside during the COVID-19 outbreak left me with a good opportunity to make improvements to my website. I made a template for posting my music, and am in the process of adding my composition portfolio into .yaml format.

Hugo works really well for writing very functionally minimal HTML!

To make a page-specific template, in the layout directory make a directory with the same name as a top-level directory in content.

```
/content/music/... <- page
...
/layouts/music/list.html <- template
```

The lookup order of templates searches there before it hits `/layouts/default/` .

I decided to make each song in `/music/` a data type instead of a markdown file. This allowed me to make a template `music.html` and have less code.
